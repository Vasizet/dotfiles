Just make setup.sh executable (chmod +x setup.sh) and execute it. (./setup.sh) and let it do the job for you.

BTW, for wofi: edit the the file located in /home/youruser/.config/wofi/config and instead of /home/nic/.config/wofi/style.css as the path for the stylesheet, use /home/youruser/.config/wofi/style.css.

That should be all, ty.
